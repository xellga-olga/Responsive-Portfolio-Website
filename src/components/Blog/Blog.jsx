        <p className={`${stylesBlog.blog_text} ${stylesBlog.animate_section}`}>
          Hi, I'm Olga, a 27-year-old frontend developer. My career started in law,
          where I spent several years. However, over time, I realized that I wasnâ€™t fulfilled
          and wanted a more creative and challenging path.
        </p>
        <p className={`${stylesBlog.blog_text} ${stylesBlog.animate_section}`}>
          I became interested in IT and soon discovered programming was the perfect
          balance of creativity and problem-solving.

          Why I Chose React
        </h2>
        <p className={`${stylesBlog.blog_text} ${stylesBlog.animate_section}`}>
          As I explored JavaScript, I quickly gravitated toward React. I loved its
          component-based approach, which made building interactive and dynamic
          applications both fun and intuitive.

          and started job hunting.
